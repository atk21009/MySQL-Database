# MySQL-Database

## Purpose

The Purpose of this database design is to store data for a small social media network. The database setup is designed to accommodate for social media users' storage of messages, posts, locations, and any orders they place on the site. 
The following sections demonstrate different database functionalities, including inserting, updating, and deleting the database. Primarily we hope to give users insert statements they can use to interact and insert data into tables as simply as possible in the next section a demonstration of this will be shown.
Each section will provide a link to a GitHub repository with better code examples and a basic explanation.

## Insert Transactions
In this next section, we demonstrate 4 simple transactions to easily input data into all of the tables. We create insert_data, orders, create_posts, and create_messages transactions which all require different information to be inserted into the transaction. However, once done all the data will be stored in the appropriate tables. 

User / Address Transaction
